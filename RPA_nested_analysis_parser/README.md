# Liquid Engine Performance Modeling
This is curently a very informal project owned by Zach to try and modle the performance of a blowdown liquid rocket engine based on RPA data.

See the design doc for more details: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18kDD3o7Ij-63oj5HY7Xj630-bdtlW_Kfc1EaNd211QM/edit#heading=h.6vdpsby9brmi

Disclaimer: It is very disorganized, and does not follow software best practices, please don't complain about this, while I'd like this to become a real project it's currently very informal, and is here just so it is tracked somewhere on github.
